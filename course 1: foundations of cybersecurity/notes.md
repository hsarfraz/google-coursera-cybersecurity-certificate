# Module 1: Welcome to the exciting world of cybersecurity

Begin your journey into cybersecurity! You'll explore the cybersecurity field, and learn about the job responsibilities of cybersecurity professionals.

Cybersecurity, or security, is the practice of ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information by protecting networks, devices, people, and data from unauthorized access or criminal exploitation.

* For example, requiring complex passwords to access sites and services improves **confidentiality** by making it much more difficult for a threat actor to compromise them.

<ins> Benefits of security </ins>

* Protects against external and internal threats
* Meets regalatory compliance (allows organisation to avoid fines and audits + upholding the ethical obligation to protect users)
* Maintains and improves business productivity
* Reduces expences

<ins> Job titles to look out for </ins>

* security analyst or specialist
* cybersecurity analyst or specialist
* security operations center (SOC) analyst
* information security analyst

<ins> Responsibilities of a security analyst </ins>

* protecting computer and network systems (the analyst has to monitor the organisations internal network)
* Installing prevention software (sometimes the security analyst will support software and hardware development)
* conducting periodic security audits (A security audit is a review of an organization's security records, activities, and other related documents)

<ins> Cyber security operations vs. Projects </ins>

* Cyber security operations focus on responding to detections and doing investigations
* Cyber security projects focus on working with other teams to build new detections or improve current detections

<ins> Core skills needed in cyber security </ins>

Transferable skills

* communication (communicating security breaches to different audiences)
* collaboration (working together with different teams such as digital forensics)
* analysis (analyse complex scenarios and what recommendations can be given)
* Problem solving (identifying a security problem and then give a solution to it)
* time manegement (knowing what tasks to prioritize)
* growth mindset (always learning new advancements in the industry & new technologies)

Technical skills

* Programming languages
* Security information and event management (SIEM) tools (log events such as log ins)
* Computer forensics (identify, analyse, and preserve criminal evidence within networks)
* Intrusion detection systems (IDS) (tools which monitor system activity and flag potential threats)
* Threat landscape knowledge (knowing the latest threats and methods in cyber crime)
* Incident response (knowing the proper way to respond to threats)

# Module 2: The evolution of cybersecurity

You will explore how cybersecurity threats have appeared and evolved alongside the adoption of computers. You will also understand how past and present cyber attacks have influenced the development of the security field. In addition, you'll get an overview of the eight security domains.

# Module 3: Protect against threats, risks, and vulnerabilities

You will learn about security frameworks and controls, which are used to mitigate organizational risk. You'll cover principles of the CIA triad and various National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) frameworks. In addition, you'll explore security ethics.

# Module 4: Cybersecurity tools and programming languages

Youâ€™ll discover common tools used by cybersecurity analysts to identify and eliminate risk. You'll learn about security information and event management (SIEM) tools, network protocol analyzers, and programming languages such as Python and SQL.
